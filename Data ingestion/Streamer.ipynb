Delivered in New York in February 1860, the Cooper Union speech dispelled doubts about Lincoln\\'s suitability for the presidency and reassured conservatives of his moderation while reaffirming his opposition to slavery to Republican progressives., ,Award-winning Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer places Lincoln and his speech in the context of the times -- an era of racism, politicized journalism, and public oratory as entertainment -- and shows how the candidate framed the speech as an opportunity to continue his famous \"debates\" with his archrival Democrat Stephen A. Douglas on the question of slavery., ,Holzer describes the enormous risk Lincoln took by appearing in New York, where he exposed himself to the country\\'s most critical audience and took on Republican Senator William Henry Seward of New York, the front runner, in his own backyard. Then he recounts a brilliant and innovative public relations campaign, as Lincoln took the speech \"on the road\" in his successful quest for the presidency.', 'History,Military History,Civil War,Biography,North American Hi...,American History,Nonfiction,Politics,Politics,Presidents,American History,American Civil War,Presidents,Us Presidents,New York', 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349048850l/106598.jpg', '743299647', '9.78E+12', 'https://goodreads.com/book/show/106598.Lincoln_at_Cooper_Union', '368', '4.18', '65', 'Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President', '816']\n",

In ,A Living Covenant,, Hartman challenges this approach revealing a Judaism grounded in a covenant-a relational framework-informed by the metaphor of marital love rather than that of parent-child dependency. This view of life places the individual firmly within community. Hartman shows that the Judaic tradition need not be understood in terms of human passivity and resignation, but rather as a vehicle by which human individuality and freedom can be expressed within a relational matrix.,\"With passion and erudition, David Hartman argues for a version of Judaism that is at once faithful to the tradition and fitted to the requirements of modernity.

The bookâ€™s arresting title, ,The Jar of Severed Hands,, comes from a 1792 report documenting a desperate break for freedom made by a group of Apache prisoners. After subduing the prisoners and killing twelve Apache men, the Spanish soldiers verified the attempted breakout by amputating the left hands of the dead and preserving them in a jar for display to their superiors.Santiagoâ€™s nuanced analysis of deportation policy credits both the Apachesâ€™ ability to exploit the Spanish governmentâ€™s dual approach and the growing awareness on the Spaniardsâ€™ part that the peoples they referred to as Apaches were a disparate and complex assortment of tribes that could not easily be subjugated. ,The Jar of Severed Hands, deepens our understanding of the dynamics of the relationship between Indian tribes and colonial powers in the Southwest borderlands.,Â\\xa0', '', 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328813408l/12789825.jpg', '806141778', '9.78E+12', 'https://goodreads.com/book/show/12789825-the-jar-of-severed-hands', '276', '4', '0', 'The Jar of Severed Hands: Spanish Deportation of Apache Prisoners of War, 1770â€“1810', '3']\n",

Pokoknya tak ada yang manusiawi. Pokoknya semua nilai terjungkirbalikkan di sini. Namun sebenarnya Ibukota yang satu ini pernah menjadi sebuah tempat tinggal yang nyaman dan teratur. Memang ini cerita masa lalu, tapi seorang Ali Sadikin pernah menjawab berbagai permasalahan tantangan dengan satu jawaban yaitu BEKERJA dan bukan duduk di belakang meja. Ali Sadikin tak pandang bulu untuk membabat siapa saja yang berniat atau sudah menyimpang dari segala ketentuan. Karya legendaris Ramadhan K.H ini bukan saja menunjukkan sepak terjang beliau yang apik, tetapi juga menceritakan kepada kita bagaimana cara yang tepat untuk mengubah Jakarta.

Through the example of four very different cultures that have the distinction of producing some of the worldâ€™s healthiest, oldest people, Robbins reveals the secrets for living an extended and fulfilling life in which our later years become a period of wisdom, vitality, and happiness. From Abkhasia in the Caucasus south of Russia, where age is beauty, and Vilcabamba in the Andes of South America, where laughter is the greatest medicine, to Hunza in Central Asia, where dance is ageless, and finally the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa, the modern Shangri-la, where people regularly live beyond a century, Robbins examines how the unique lifestyles of these peoples can influence and improve our own.,Bringing the traditions of these ancient and vibrantly healthy cultures together with the latest breakthroughs in medical science, Robbins reveals that, remarkably, they both point in the same direction. The result is an inspirational synthesis of years of research into healthy aging in which Robbins has isolated the characteristics that will enable us to live long andâ€“most importantâ€“joyous lives. With an emphasis on simple, wholesome, but satisfying fare, and the addition of a manageable daily exercise routine, many people can experience great improvement in the quality of their lives now and for many years to come. But perhaps more surprising is Robbinsâ€™ discovery that it is not diet and exercise alone that helps people to live well past one hundred. The quality of personal relationships is enormously important. With startling medical evidence about the effects of our interactions with others, Robbins asserts that loneliness has more impact on lifespan than such known vices as smoking. There is clearly a strong beneficial power to love and connection.,â€œWe all have the tools to live longer lives, and to remain active, productive, and resourceful until the very end,â€\\x9d Robbins writes. ,Healthy at 100, strives to improve both the quality and the quantity of our remaining yearsâ€“no matter how old or how healthy we might currently beâ€“and to reverse the social stigma on aging.
